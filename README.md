# Example Flask application for my Medium article

This is the app that I created for [my Medium article.](https://medium.com/@stefan.foldesi/securing-your-flask-app-development-ssl-certificate-and-ajax-csrf-protection-48a9730a97c6)

It showcases the solution to two problems, that I encountered for Flask development:

- Automatic generation of an SSL certificate for the devserver
- CSRF protection of AJAX requests, especially for frontend applications that don't use Jinda
